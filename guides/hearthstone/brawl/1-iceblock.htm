This deck usually cannot beat:<ul>
  <li>Druid, because of the +1 armor hero power.
  <li>Priest, because of the +2 health hero power.
  <li>Warrior, because of the +2 armor hero power.
</ul>
However, you can beat these classes if you gain stable board control in the first few turns. This is unlikely, so conceding leads to more wins against easier classes.
<hr>
This deck usually always beats:<ul>
  <li>Mage.
  <li>Paladin.
  <li>Rogue.
  <li>Shaman.
  <li>Warlock, unless they Renounce Darkness and become a Druid, Priest, or Warrior.
</ul>
However, you can still lose if you do not draw any additional damage or if your opponent draws sources of healing.
<hr>
Mulligan for cards that aren't Ice Block.<ul>
  <li>This will reduce your chances of overdrawing damage later on if your hand becomes full.
  <li>If you have cards that utilize secret synergy, it is still not wise to keep Ice Blocks as you will most likely draw 1 within the first few turns.
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li><span class=hs-common>Arcane Intellect</span>:<ul>
    <li>Do not use this card unless your opponent has drawn multiple cards. Fatigue is an important part of this deck and should not be accelerated.
  </ul>
  <li><span class=hs-common>Arcane Missiles</span>:<ul>
    <li>Check for Counterspell before you use this card.
    <li>Face damage is the most important goal, so try to use this spell when your opponent's board is as empty as possible.

  </ul>
  <li><span class=hs-common>Arcanologist</span>:<ul>
    <li>Do not use this card unless you have no more Ice Blocks in your hand, your opponent has drawn multiple cards, or your deck has no more secrets in it. Fatigue is an important part of this deck and should not be accelerated.
    <li>This card can save you if you run out of Ice Blocks in your hand.
  </ul>
  <li><span class=hs-legendary>Archmage Antonidas</span>:<ul>
    <li>Save useless 0-mana spells for additional Fireballs.

  </ul>
  <li><span class=hs-rare>Blizzard</span>:<ul>
    <li>Check for Counterspell before you use this card.
    <li>Depending on which deck your opponent is playing, you can save this card to prevent them from attacking you and popping Ice Block. This can allow you to use your remaining mana to deal damage or develop the board.

  <li><span class=hs-epic>Cabalist's Tome</span>:<ul>
    <li>Check for Counterspell before you use this card.

  </ul>
  <li><span class=hs-common>Coin</span>:<ul>
    <li>If you do not have cards that aren't Ice Block that benefit from being played 1 turn earlier in the first few turns, use your Coin to use an additional hero power on turn 1.
  </ul>
  <li><span class=hs-common>Duplicate</span>:<ul>
    <li>If you have a valuable minion and enough space in your hand, save this card to duplicate your minion.

  <li><span class=hs-common>Forgotten Torch</span>:<ul>
    <li>Check for Counterspell before you use this card.

  </ul>
  <li><span class=hs-epic>Ice Block</span>:<ul>
    <li>Do not use Ice Block unless your opponent has lethal. This allows you to use your hero power more often, such as on turns 2, 3, and 4.

    <li>Check for Counterspell before you use this card.

  <li><span class=hs-epic>Pyroblast</span>:<ul>
    <li>Check for Counterspell before you use this card.
