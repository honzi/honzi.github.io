<ul>
  <li>If your opponent does not have a threatening board and your Shifter Zeruses aren't very good, you should wait a turn for better shift results.
  <li>Mulligan:<ul>
    <li>It is typically best to mulligan for a hand full of only Shifter Zerus.
    <li>Some random class spells can be worth keeping, such as card draw or powerful board clears.
  </ul>
  <li>Since all spells are random and potentially not very impactful, board control is the primary way to victory.
  <li>Use as few Shifter Zeruses as possible to maintain board control, for having significantly less options than your opponent will put you at a big disadvantage.
</ul>
