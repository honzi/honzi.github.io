This deck is designed to easily beat many normal and heroic bosses in "Solo Adventures" mode by using a 5-mana 5-card combo that only requires 280 dust.
<hr>
Playing:<ul>
  <li>Hard mulligan for pieces of the 5-card combo.
  <li>Do not play pieces of the combo until you have all of them.
  <li>Survive until at least turn 5 and execute the combo:<ol>
    <li>Play Knife Juggler.
    <li>Play Radiant Elemental.
    <li>Play Test Subject.
    <li>Cast Embalmbing Ritual on the Test Subject.
    <li>Cast Holy Smite on the Test Subject.
    <li>Repeat steps 4, 5, and 6 until the enemy boss is defeated.
  </ol>
  <li>Try to survive as long as possible to get the combo, but restart the game once there is no hope. Eventually you will succeed.
</ul>
