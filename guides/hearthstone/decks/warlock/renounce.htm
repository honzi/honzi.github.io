Playing:<ul>
  <li>Hard mulligan for Renounce Darkness.
  <li>The coin should not be used for additional card draw, since it becomes a lot better after Renounce Darkness is used. You can use the coin to reduce your hand size from 10 to 9 at the end of your turn, since the mana cost of the Warlock card you draw will be reduced by 1 anyway.
  <li>After you have played Renounce Darkness, avoid picking another one when discovering cards. It only replaces Warlock cards, which you no longer have.
</ul>
<hr>
Some cards are helpful enough that they should be included in every Renounce Warlock deck:<table class=center>
