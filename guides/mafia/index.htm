<ul>
  <li>Cars can be pushed thru invisible walls by other cars, which allows you to enter and exit the car to bypass the wall.
  <li>If you are driving over the speed limit, you can honk your horn to make cars attempt to move out of your way. Relative to the direction you are facing: cars on your left will turn left and cars on your right will turn right.
  <li>It is possible to start the driving portion with your car already started, which saves time. This can reliably be done by driving your car into the water to the right of the tunnel and then selecting Retry.
  <li>The parking attendant can be attacked with your gun or punched when he speaks to you, but he will grab his gun and fire back. Under certain circumstances, you can get his gun.
  <li>You can cancel weapon reloads by holstering your weapon or switching to another weapon.
  <li>You can side roll directly into thin walls to see thru them momentarily if your camera is nearly in 1st person.
  <li>You can side roll onto objects that can otherwise not be climbed by aiming your roll to end on top of the object.
