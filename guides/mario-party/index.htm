When farming coins, you should maximize the net worth of all 4 players:
<ul>
  <li>Do not pay coins for any actions that don't result in net gain of coins, such as paying coins to steal coins from another player.
  <li>Enable bonus stars.
  <li>Go for extra coins in minigames whenever possible.
  <li>Only purchase items if they are needed to get stars, such as skeleton keys.
  <li>Stars should be purchased as much as possible.
  <li>The group of 3 players in 1v3 minigames should win.
</ul>
