Hitman 2: Silent Assassin Demo:
<ul>
  <li>Commands that are turned on or off, such as god and invisible, are only set to their default values when the game is started.
  <li>Completing the mission exits the game, but you can use the reload command to keep playing.
  <li>Delivery Boy:<ul>
    <li>A bug can occur that causes the delivery boy to teleport to his car and begin driving away.
    <li>If you knock him out with anesthetic and take his clothing, he will attempt to drive away without retreiving his clothing.
  </ul>
  <li>Guards:<ul>
    <li>If you knock one out with anesthetic or punches and take their gun, they will panic and hide whenever they see you. If you don't take it, they will pick it back up and eventually resume normal behavior.
    <li>If you knock one out with anesthetic and take their clothing but don't take their gun, they will eventually resume normal behavior despite only wearing boxers.
  </ul>
  <li>Holstering your weapon will reload it quicker than a normal reload, if you have sufficient remaining ammo.
  <li>Open the console with "~".
  <li>Postman:<ul>
    <li>If you knock him out and take his clothing, he will eventually resume normal behavior. His animations will behave strangely, because he will be constantly trying to cover himself while also attempting animations that require arm movement. His eyes will be popping out of their sockets and his jaw will look broken. The maid he gives the flowers to will just shrug at him and he'll walk away.
    <li>When he walks up to the guard at the main entrance to be searched, he is actually walking towards that guard's current location. If you remove that guard's gun and scare him away, the postman will walk to his location and remain there forever. Since the guard cannot conduct the search while hiding, the postman never continues into the house.
  </ul>
  <li>Press ESC when the console is open to clear what you have currently typed.
  <li>Press ESC when the ending cutscene begins to save time, since the cutscene duration gets added to your final time.
  <li>Run at a 45 or 90 degree angle when climbing stairs to not get slowed down.
  <li>The Don:<ul>
    <li>If the Don is alerted and hiding in the central room, shoot the windows from outside to get him and anybody else inside that room to go out on the balcony. They will attempt to shoot you if they see you.
  </ul>
  <li>The end of the wall to the right of your starting location by the delivery entrance can be clipped thru to give you access to the hills behind your starting location.
  <li>You can shoot thru doors with certain weapons.
  <li>Your weapons do not have any recoil if you are leaning left or right.
</ul>
