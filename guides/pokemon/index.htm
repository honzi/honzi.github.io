<ul>
  <li>After you obtain HMs, you should have Pokémon that know Cut, Fly, Strength, and Surf with you at all times. Flash is only required in the Rock Tunnel.
  <li>Catch a Caterpie in Viridian Forest, train it to level 17 so it learns Sleep Powder, and use it to catch a level 8 Abra. This Abra, once evolved into a Kadabra, will be a very powerful Pokémon that can easily solo the rest of the game.
  <li>Defeat every trainer before moving on to another area, as you may not be able to battle some trainers after certain conditions are met.
  <li>It is better to catch or defeat the west Snorlax first:<ul>
    <li>The east Snorlax can be partially bypassed by using Surf.
    <li>The west Snorlax blocks the entrance to the top of Route 16, which goes downhill towards Fuchsia city. Going uphill is a lot slower, so having easy access to the top is more convenient.
  </ul>
  <li>Since training Pokémon makes them stronger than wild Pokémon of the same level, it is best to trade for NPC Pokémon using the lowest level Pokémon possible.
  <li>The Pay Day move can be used to gain unlimited money:<ul>
    <li>Blue version can catch a Meowth, which learns Pay Day at level 17.
    <li>Red version can use TM16 to teach Pay Day to a suitable Pokémon.
  </ul>
  <li>Your Bicycle should be the top item in your inventory. You can deposit items that are above it to move it up.
</ul>
