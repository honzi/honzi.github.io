<ul>
  <li>For skillpoints: complete the 2 quickest available dailys.
  <li>For evermarks and isk: complete as many dailys as possible.
  <li>To convert evermarks to isk: spend 2,500 evermarks to complete 1 daily that you wouldn't otherwise be able to do. Must be the first daily you complete that day.
  <li>Recommended fits: <a href=stratios.htm#dailys>Stratios-Dailys</a> for omega and <a href=vexor.htm#dailys>Vexor-Dailys</a> for alpha.

    <td>Daily Goal

    <td>Tips for Quick Completion
  <tr>
    <td>Armor Repair other Capsuleers
    <td>Medium
    <td>Damage and repair an alt or a trusted friend in a ship with at least 2,500 armor hp.
  <tr>
    <td>Capture/Defend Contested FW Complex
    <td>Hard
    <td>Recommended to skip unless you are actively participating in faction warfare.
  <tr>
    <td>Complete 3 Jumps
    <td>Easy
    <td>Either do while traveling to another daily in a different system, or set destination 2 jumps away from your current station and back.
  <tr>
    <td>Destroy 25 non-capsuleers
    <td>Medium
    <td>Do <a href=security-missions.htm>security missions</a> or find npc spawns in asteroid belts in &lt;=0.8 systems.
  <tr>
    <td>Gain 50 LP for any corporation
    <td>Easy
    <td>Do <a href=security-missions.htm>security missions</a> if you also have to destroy 25 non-capsuleers, otherwise do <a href=distribution-missions.htm>distribution missions</a>.
  <tr>
    <td>Manufacture an Item
    <td>Easy
    <td>The cheapest item to create is Nova Rockets from a 10/20 BPO. If you're on an alt with no isk, use the reward from other dailys to pay for it.
  <tr>
    <td>Scan 5 Signatures
    <td>Easy
    <td><a href=index.htm#rookie-systems>Rookie systems</a> have enough easily scannable signatures.
