<ul>
  <li>1 AU = 149,597,870.7 km
  <li>AI of enemies that target your drones can be abused. While your drones are orbiting your ship, let the enemies target them. Quickly return your drones to your drone bay until the enemies target your ship again, then immediately relaunch your drones and use them to attack the enemy ships. They will not retarget your drones for a short period of time, which may be long enough to destroy one of them.
  <li>Always have your skill training and original blueprint research queues as full as possible.
  <li>Containers listed as "Audit Log Secure Containers" cannot be repackaged for 21 days after various actions:<ul>
    <li>Assembling the container.
    <li>Changing the container password.
    <li>Changing the container config, such as locking items by default or requiring a password for interacting with the container.
    <li>Locking or unlocking items within the container.
    <li>Renaming the container.
  </ul>
  <li>Do not accept missions that you cannot complete before the Bonus Reward timer expires.
  <li>Drones should remain in your drone bay until they are needed to attack something.
  <li>Keep ship price low when fitting:<ul>
    <li>Abyssal modules have no estimated value, therefore using cheap abyssals can reduce the value of the killmail your ship creates.
    <li>Keep your cargo as empty as possible by dropping off acquired loot at a station.
    <li>Never fly special edition ships.
    <li>Only use tech 1 and tech 2 modules that you need. Compare variations to find the optimal choice.
  </ul>
  <li>"Look At" a ship and then "Track" that same ship to keep the camera behind it regardless of which direction it is moving.
  <li>Market window loading lag can be reduced by closing the window when your "Groups" tab contains a group that never has more than a few items listed, such as Amarr Shuttle Blueprint.
  <li>Move your assets to a single station for easier management and tracking, unless strategic asset placement is required.<ul>
    <li>Use Station Warehouse Containers to easily manage large assortments of items in one station.
  </ul>
  <li>Socket closure can be detected early:<ul>
    <li>Active modules will continue to cycle, but will not drain your capacitor.
    <li>Other pilots that warp away will still be displayed on your overview, despite being multiple AU away.
  </ul>
  <li>Sort your items by "Group" to always have them in a predictable order.
  <li>The angle your camera is facing when you dock will be the same when you undock, despite any ship spinning you may do while docked. One specific angle is used if you have not yet undocked since logging in, and it is worth learning that angle at stations you frequently login within.
  <li>Use drones and/or energy weapons with tech 1 ammo to save ISK by never purchasing ammo.
  <li>"View Outside" when docked in a citadel to not have to load and transisition to the interior environment.
  <li>When running missions, set your destination to the mission system and then add a waypoint back to your hub station.
  <li>You should stay next to your deployed Mobile Tractor Unit and scoop it once you are done using it, as it can be <a href=hunting-deployables.htm>fairly easily destroyed by other players</a>.
</ul>
