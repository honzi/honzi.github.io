  <li>"Drone Danger" indicates if enemy ships will switch to attacking your drones after they have already attacked your ship:<ul>
    <li>Small drones are sometimes attacked by enemy frigates.
    <li>Medium drones are often attacked by enemy ships smaller than a cruiser.
    <li>Heavy drones are often attacked by enemy ships smaller than a battleship.
    <li>All mutated drones get attacked more often and therefore should be avoided.
  </ul>
  <li>If your drones are getting attacked much more than usual, leave your ship and board it again while docked.
  <li>Some missions may require specific items or modules. Keep them in your mission station until needed:<ul>
    <li>Some acceleration gates require you to have a <a href=keys.htm>key</a> in your cargo.
    <li>Miner II for missions that require you to mine ore.
  </ul>
