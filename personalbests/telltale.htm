Katjaa season 1 episode 3:<ul>
  <li>K: "Tell me what happened when you were locked in the fridge. At the dairy."
  <li>L: "It doesn't matter. Larry died."
  <li>K: "Did you kill him?"
  <li>L: "He didn't tell you?"
  <li>K: "Nobody tells me anything. How long has everybody else known about you?"
  <li>L: "They haven't."
  <li>K: "Well, thanks. I'm not happy to hear it, but thanks."
  <li>Katjaa will remember that.
</ul>
