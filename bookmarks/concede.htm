<ul>
  <li>Note: These criteria only apply to rank floors.
  <li>Baku or Genn is automatic concede, due to improved hero power being good but not interesting.
  <li>Every player is squelched, as emotes beyond the initial greetings do not add any enjoyment.
  <li>Galakrond is only fun when played in Priest, so other Galakrond decks earn a concede.
  <li>If no start of game or quest concede criteria are met, then must continue playing at least until cards not listed in the <a href=https://iterami.com/Guides.htm/hearthstone/fun-random.htm>fun random list</a> are played.
  <li>Mill decks that play Coldlight Oracle aren't fun, because fun random decks often have many cards in hand.
  <li>Prince Keleseth, and other such cards, aren't very fun when played early.
  <li>Zoo-based decks, such as Murloc spam or Lackey spam, are also concedes due to lack of fun.
</ul>
