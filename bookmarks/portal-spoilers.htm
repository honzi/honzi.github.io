      <li>Carefully jump down to any portalable surface on the bottom level without activating any faith plates.
      <li>Create the 2nd portal and activate the faith plate beneath your 1st portal. It should activate additional faith plates until you reach the top level. If it does not, then you can activate the faith plate on the bottom level beneath your 1st portal.
      <li>Jump across to the exit. If you don't make it, turn around and attempt to land on any platform below you. Activate any of the previously-activated faith plates to try again.

      <li>Create the 1st portal on the portalable surface near the repulsion gel.
      <li>While facing away from the starting door, create the 2nd portal on the portalable surface directly above you.

    <td>Challenge #1: Laser Field Excursion
    <td><ol>
      <li>Create the 1st portal on the portalable surface within the tractor beam cage. Use whichever portal is more difficult for you to use quickly, such as having it slightly more difficult to right-click instead of left-click or vice versa.
      <li>Create the 2nd portal on the first strip of portalable surface on the ground. Ride the tractor beam until you get close to the laser field, then use the portalable surfaces on the ceiling to move fowards and downwards. Repeat until you reach the other side.
      <li>Push the button to unlock 2 cubes. Return to the other side as in step #2 and place one of the cubes on the button behind them.
      <li>Return to the other side as in step #2 and you will reach the exit.

    <td>Challenge #2: Laser Ball Pit
    <td><ol>

  <tr>
    <td>Challenge #3: r_portal_use_dlights 1
    <td><ol>
      <li>This chamber utilizes the r_portal_use_dlights command to allow portals to light up entirely dark areas. Make sure the command is working properly.
      <li>Create a portal at the end of the hallway where the light from the starting area ends. Walk towards it and turn left 90 degrees. Create the 2nd portal on the wall ahead of you past the first pit.
      <li>Walk through the portal and turn left. Slowly walk along the wall your 2nd protal is on and keep re-creating it until you reach the 2nd pit.
      <li>Stop walking, but continue re-creating a portal further and further along the wall until the 2nd pit ends. Create the other portal where you stopped walking and walk through it.
      <li>Continue along the same wall with the same process as step #3 until you reach the small 3rd pit.
      <li>Create a portal on the opposite side of the 3rd pit and continue moving it upwards until you create it on the ceiling above a ledge above the 3rd pit. Create the other portal where you stopped walking and walk through it.
      <li>Drop directly down on the side opposite the 3rd pit and land on the grating.
      <li>Look around and find the faith plate and activate it. Turn right around the corner and activate the next faith plate to reach the exit.

    <td>Challenge #4: One of Everything
    <td><ol>
      <li>Jump down onto either side of the laser field emitters along the walls and walk towards the laser emitter. Create the 1st portal on the portalable wall underneathe the light strip.
      <li>Crouch and activate the pedestal button below the laser field to temporarily disable the laser field. Activate the faith plate from the side opposite the pedestal button to land on the glass panel.
      <li>Jump towards the bottom of the stairs and run up them to avoid getting shot by the turret. Create the 2nd portal on the portalable surface at the top of the stairs.
      <li>Go through the portal while crouched and destroy the turret by picking it up and walking close enough to the material emancipation grill.
      <li>Return through the portal and pick up the reflection cube through the grating. Move it around the glass and onto the button below it.
      <li>Go back and activate the pedestal button below the laser field. Activate the faith plate again to go over the grating. Drop down and pick up the reflection cube. Carry it while riding the track platform up and then drop it down onto the cube button.
      <li>Jump to the bottom of the stairs. Pick up the edgeless safety cube and place it on the sphere button.
      <li>Go through the portal and pick up the companion cube. Return through the portal and place the companion cube on the button behind the grating.
      <li>Go back and activate the pedestal button below the laser field. Activate the faith plate again to go over the grating. Move the reflection cube to the regular button. Take the companion cube up the track platform and through the portal and leave it under the laser.
      <li>Go back and pick up the reflection cube through the grating and carry it through the portal to the companion cube. Place the companion cube below the laser right at the edge closest to the emitter. Balance the reflection cube on top of the companion cube to activate the laser relay which will release a franken cube onto the glass.
      <li>Move the franken cube onto the button behind the grating.
      <li>Return through the portal and adjust the reflection cube so that it fires at the laser catcher behind the grating. The stairs will lower and the gels will flow. You can now walk through the material emancipation grill.
      <li>Create the 1st portal above the tractor beam and the 2nd portal on the portalable wall. Go back and activate the pedestal button below the laser field to block the propulsion and repulsion gels from entering the tractor beam. Once the wall above the exit is covered in conversion gel, walk through the material emancipation grill to close your portals.
      <li>Create the 1st portal on the portalable wall underneathe the light strip. Activate the pedestal button below the laser field and return via the faith plate to create the 2nd portal at the top of the stairs. Move the reflection cube behind the grating to prepare to place it on the cube button.
      <li>Activate the pedestal button below the laser field and go over the grating via the faith plate. Place the reflection cube onto the cube button.
      <li>Return the edgeless safety cube to the sphere button.
      <li>Move the portal that was below the light strip over to the conversion gel above the exit. Activate the pedestal button below the laser field to activate the light bridge, return via the faith plate, and quickly enter the portal to reach the exit.
    </ol>

    <td>Challenge #5: Tossing Cubes
    <td><ol>
      <li>Toss the weighted cube into the top of the grating surrounding the first button to raise the 1st platform.
      <li>Toss the edgeless safety cube in such a way that it continues rolling down the center of the path towards the observation room. The cube is not guaranteed to activate the button, so you will have to try again if the 2nd platform does not stay raised.
      <li>Toss the companion cube onto the button to raise the 3rd platform.
      <li>Toss the reflection cube onto the platform at an angle in order to reflect the laser into the catcher and raise the 4th platform.
      <li>Toss the franken cube in such a way that it walks left into the tractor beam and raise the 5th platform.
      <li>Once all platforms are raised, the exit will open.
    </ol>

    <td>Practice Chamber
    <td><ol>
      <li>Get a weighted cube, a companion cube, and an edgeless safety cube from the droppers.
      <li>Use the cubes to activate the 3 buttons located near the starting door.
      <li>Create the 1st portal within the newly-uncovered portalable wall behind the grating where the turret is. Create the 2nd portal on any convenient portalable surface.
      <li>Push the button near the 1st portal. You can use a franken cube to defeat the turret.
      <li>Activate the laser emitter and use it to activate the laser relay in the chamber containing the starting door and exit. The exit is now open.
