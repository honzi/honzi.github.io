      <li>Activate the pedestal button near the starting door to get a companion cube. Pick it up and take it with you to the next pedestal button.
      <li>Activate the 2nd pedestal button. You will have to drop your cube to do so, but you must remember to take it with you afterwards.
      <li>Drop down into the darkness and land on the grating. Continue and activate the 3rd pedestal button.
      <li>While carrying the companion cube, activate the faith plate. Create the 1st portal on the surface covered in conversion gel. Look back towards the direction you came from, zoom in, and create the 2nd portal on the barely visible surface covered in conversion gel. Go thru the portal with the companion cube.
      <li>Jump down into the raised section that you flew over after activating the faith plate and activate the cube button.
      <li>Return to the central chamber containing the gel pipes. Look down, and shoot a portal onto the surface covered in conversion gel that is below the orange tractor beam. Activate the faith plate again, recreate the portal if needed, and walk thru it.
      <li>Activate the 2nd faith plate and enter the blue tractor beam. Once it ends, drop down into the orange tractor beam. Activate the pedestal button visible above you before the material emancipation grill. If you miss it, you can activate the faith plate after the orange tractor beam to return to the beginning for another loop.
      <li>Immediately after the material emancipation grill, turn right and be prepared to fire a portal onto the surface covered in conversion gel within the alcove. This step can also be attempted again if you miss. Create the other portal on the conversion gel surface you encountered in step #4, enter it, and push the button.
      <li>Return thru the portal and create the other portal on the barely visible conversion gel surface as in step #4. Walk thru, drop down to the area with the faith plate, and push the button that was hidden behind 2 glass panels.
      <li>Return to the blue tractor beam as in step #6 and #7. You will find the open exit on your right side before when you would normally drop down to the orange tractor beam.

    <td>Aperture Dream #1
    <td><ol>
      <li>Create a portal above the starting door to quickly be able to return to maximum height. You can also hold the crouch keybind to not bounce on the repulsion gel at the bottom.
      <li>Obtain the edgeless safety cube from the alcove above the missing portalable tile at the bottom.
      <li>Jump out and bounce your way to the sphere button, which is slightly lower than the edgeless safety cube location and towards the exit. This will unlock the companion cube alcove, which is visible from the cube button alcove and marked with the same symbol as the sphere button.
      <li>Create a portal at the bottom level to return to maximum height and obtain the companion cube from its alcove.
      <li>Return again thru the portal and enter the cube button alcove located near the starting door and activate it.
      <li>Return again thru the portal and you can reach the exit. Jump before going into the portal for increased forward speed while falling.
    </ol>
  <tr id=aperture-dream-2>
    <td>Aperture Dream #2
    <td><ol>
      <li>Viewed from the grating at the starting door, create the 1st portal on the portalable surface that is closest to the left of the exit.
      <li>Carefully jump down to any portalable surface on the bottom level without activating any faith plates.
      <li>Create the 2nd portal and activate the faith plate beneath your 1st portal. It should activate additional faith plates until you reach the top level. If it does not, then you can activate the faith plate on the bottom level beneath your 1st portal.
      <li>Jump across to the exit. If you don't make it, turn around and attempt to land on any platform below you. Activate any of the previously-activated faith plates to try again.

  <tr id=challenge-1>
    <td>Challenge #1: Laser Field Excursion
    <td><ol>
      <li>Create the 1st portal on the portalable surface within the tractor beam cage. Use whichever portal is more difficult for you to use quickly, such as having it slightly more difficult to right-click instead of left-click or vice versa.
      <li>Create the 2nd portal on the first strip of portalable surface on the ground. Ride the tractor beam until you get close to the laser field, then use the portalable surfaces on the ceiling to move forwards and downwards. Repeat until you reach the other side.
      <li>Push the button to unlock 2 cubes. Return to the other side as in step #2 and place one of the cubes on the button behind them.
      <li>Return to the other side as in step #2 and you will reach the exit.
    </ol>
  <tr id=challenge-2>
    <td>Challenge #2: Laser Ball Pit
    <td><ol>
      <li>Carefully balance on and jump between edgeless safety cubes on your way to the exit.
    </ol>
  <tr id=challenge-3>
    <td>Challenge #3: r_portal_use_dlights 1
    <td><ol>
      <li>This chamber utilizes the r_portal_use_dlights command to allow portals to light up entirely dark areas. Make sure the command is working properly.
      <li>Create a portal at the end of the hallway where the light from the starting area ends. Walk towards it and turn left 90 degrees. Create the 2nd portal on the wall ahead of you past the first pit.
      <li>Walk thru the portal and turn left. Slowly walk along the wall your 2nd portal is on and keep re-creating it until you reach the 2nd pit.
      <li>Stop walking, but continue re-creating a portal further and further along the wall until the 2nd pit ends. Create the other portal where you stopped walking and walk thru it.
      <li>Continue along the same wall with the same process as step #3 until you reach the small 3rd pit.
      <li>Create a portal on the opposite side of the 3rd pit and continue moving it upwards until you create it on the ceiling above a ledge above the 3rd pit. Create the other portal where you stopped walking and walk thru it.
      <li>Drop directly down on the side opposite the 3rd pit and land on the grating.
      <li>Look around and find the faith plate and activate it. Turn right around the corner and activate the next faith plate to reach the exit.
    </ol>
  <tr id=challenge-4>
    <td>Challenge #4: One of Everything
    <td><ol>
      <li>Jump down onto either side of the laser field emitters along the walls and walk towards the laser emitter. Create the 1st portal on the portalable wall underneath the light strip.
      <li>Crouch and activate the pedestal button below the laser field to temporarily disable the laser field. Activate the faith plate from the side opposite the pedestal button to land on the glass panel.
      <li>Jump towards the bottom of the stairs and run up them to avoid getting shot by the turret. Create the 2nd portal on the portalable surface at the top of the stairs.
      <li>Go thru the portal while crouched and destroy the turret by picking it up and walking close enough to the material emancipation grill.
      <li>Return thru the portal and pick up the reflection cube thru the grating. Move it around the glass and onto the button below it.
      <li>Go back and activate the pedestal button below the laser field. Activate the faith plate again to go over the grating. Drop down and pick up the reflection cube. Carry it while riding the track platform up and then drop it down onto the cube button.
      <li>Jump to the bottom of the stairs. Pick up the edgeless safety cube and place it on the sphere button.
      <li>Go thru the portal and pick up the companion cube. Return thru the portal and place the companion cube on the button behind the grating.
      <li>Go back and activate the pedestal button below the laser field. Activate the faith plate again to go over the grating. Move the reflection cube to the regular button. Take the companion cube up the track platform and thru the portal and leave it under the laser.
      <li>Go back and pick up the reflection cube thru the grating and carry it thru the portal to the companion cube. Place the companion cube below the laser right at the edge closest to the emitter. Balance the reflection cube on top of the companion cube to activate the laser relay which will release a franken cube onto the glass.
      <li>Move the franken cube onto the button behind the grating.
      <li>Return thru the portal and adjust the reflection cube so that it fires at the laser catcher behind the grating. The stairs will lower and the gels will flow. You can now walk thru the material emancipation grill.
      <li>Create the 1st portal above the tractor beam and the 2nd portal on the portalable wall. Go back and activate the pedestal button below the laser field to block the propulsion and repulsion gels from entering the tractor beam. Once the wall above the exit is covered in conversion gel, walk thru the material emancipation grill to close your portals.
      <li>Create the 1st portal on the portalable wall underneath the light strip. Activate the pedestal button below the laser field and return via the faith plate to create the 2nd portal at the top of the stairs. Move the reflection cube behind the grating to prepare to place it on the cube button.
      <li>Activate the pedestal button below the laser field and go over the grating via the faith plate. Place the reflection cube onto the cube button.
      <li>Return the edgeless safety cube to the sphere button.
      <li>Move the portal that was below the light strip over to the conversion gel above the exit. Activate the pedestal button below the laser field to activate the light bridge, return via the faith plate, and quickly enter the portal to reach the exit.

    <td>Challenge #5: Tossing Cubes
    <td><ol>
      <li>Toss the weighted cube into the top of the grating surrounding the first button to raise the 1st platform.
      <li>Toss the edgeless safety cube in such a way that it continues rolling down the center of the path towards the observation room. The cube is not guaranteed to activate the button, so you will have to try again if the 2nd platform does not stay raised.
      <li>Toss the companion cube onto the button to raise the 3rd platform.
      <li>Toss the reflection cube onto the platform at an angle in order to reflect the laser into the catcher and raise the 4th platform.
      <li>Toss the franken cube in such a way that it walks left into the tractor beam and raise the 5th platform.
      <li>Once all platforms are raised, the exit will open.
