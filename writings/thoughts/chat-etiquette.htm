* Do not assume that anybody can read your mind:
  * Say `afk` if you are leaving for a medium+ amount of time, with an optional number of hours and/or minutes.
  * Say `brb` if you are leaving for a small amount of time, with an optional number of minutes and/or seconds.
* Treat chat as you would an improv:
  * A less restrictive version of `yes, and` keeps the conversation healthy.
  * Make every participant `look good`.
