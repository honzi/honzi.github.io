Use of Head Movements to gather Information for Sound-based Spacial Awareness<br><br>

By carefully and repeatedly rotating one's head ±45° along the x, y, and z axes and then returning one's head ∓45° along the x, y, and z axes, one can gather information about the direction and distance of audible sources of sound. This information can be used to improve one's spatial awareness by quickly generating an estimated 3D model of one's environment containing the origins of each sound heard. Be sure to do this at your own pace, as you may risk neck injury!
