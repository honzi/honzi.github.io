<a href=../index.htm>honzi.cz</a>/<a href=index.htm>Writings</a>/Nobody<br>
I am a designer of games that nobody plays.<br>
I am a writer of stories that nobody reads.<br>
I am a developer of software that nobody uses.<br>
They don't give feedback quite like nobody does.<br><br>

They say it is strange and they say it is weird.<br>
They say it is wrong and they say it is unhealthy.<br>
They question the very motives of my work.<br>
They don't understand my projects quite like nobody does.<br><br>

Nobody knows where it all will lead.<br>
Nobody knows how things will change.<br>
Nobody has the key to the worlds I recreate.<br>
They don't have my love quite like nobody does.
