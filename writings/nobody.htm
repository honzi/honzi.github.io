<pre>
I am a designer of games that nobody plays.
I am a writer of stories that nobody reads.
I am a developer of software that nobody uses.
They don't give feedback quite like nobody does.

They say it is strange and they say it is weird.
They say it is wrong and they say it is unhealthy.
They question the very motives of my work.
They don't understand my projects quite like nobody does.

Nobody knows where it all will lead.
Nobody knows how things will change.
Nobody has the key to the worlds I recreate.
They don't have my love quite like nobody does.
