<ul>
  <li>Do not assume that anybody can read your mind:<ul>
    <li>Say `afk` if you are leaving for a medium+ amount of time, with an optional number of hours and/or minutes.
    <li>Say `brb` if you are leaving for a small amount of time, with an optional number of minutes and/or seconds.
  </ul>
  <li>Treat chat as you would an improv:<ul>
    <li>A less restrictive version of `yes, and` keeps the conversation healthy.
    <li>Make every participant `look good`.
  </ul>
</ul>
