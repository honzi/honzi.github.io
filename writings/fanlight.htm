"Fanlight" = The combination of a noisy fan and a bright light that can be turned on in the central bathroom in Honzi's house.

Option #1: "Fanlight" On:
* Pros:
  * Nobody outside the bathroom will attempt to communicate with you.
  * The smells of your pooping are sucked out of the bathroom.
  * The sounds of your pooping cannot be heard outside the bathroom.
* Cons:
  * Everybody outside the bathroom knows that there is somebody inside pooping, but you may still remain anonymous.
  * You do not know what is going on outside the bathroom. You can feel vibrations through the walls, but you cannot be sure they are caused by footsteps.
  * Your pooping is more illuminated.

Option #2: "Fanlight" Off:
* Pros:
  * Outsiders have a lower chance of knowing that there is somebody inside pooping.
  * You have a much higher chance of knowing what is going on outside the bathroom, as sounds and possible burglars are much more easily heard.
  * You poop in the shade.
* Cons:
  * Outsiders may attempt to communicate with you.
  * The smells of your pooping will linger.
  * The sounds of your pooping are more likely to be heard outside the bathroom, which may affect your anonymity.

Conclusion:
* If modesty and consideration of the bathroom experience of others are higher priority, keep the "fanlight" on.
* If stealth and awareness are higher priority, keep the "fanlight" off.
