"Fanlight" = The combination of a noisy fan and a bright light that can be turned on in the central bathroom in Honzi's old house.<br><br>

Option #1: "Fanlight" On:
<ul>
  <li>Pros:<ul>
    <li>Nobody outside the bathroom will attempt to communicate with you.
    <li>The smells of your pooping are sucked out of the bathroom.
    <li>The sounds of your pooping cannot be heard outside the bathroom.
  </ul>
  <li>Cons:<ul>
    <li>Everybody outside the bathroom knows that there is somebody inside pooping, but you may still remain anonymous.
    <li>You do not know what is going on outside the bathroom. You can feel vibrations through the walls, but you cannot be sure they are caused by footsteps.
    <li>Your pooping is more illuminated.
  </ul>
</ul>

Option #2: "Fanlight" Off:
<ul>
  <li>Pros:<ul>
    <li>Outsiders have a lower chance of knowing that there is somebody inside pooping.
    <li>You have a much higher chance of knowing what is going on outside the bathroom, as sounds and possible burglars are much more easily heard.
    <li>You poop in the shade.
  </ul>
  <li>Cons:<ul>
    <li>Outsiders may attempt to communicate with you.
    <li>The smells of your pooping will linger.
    <li>The sounds of your pooping are more likely to be heard outside the bathroom, which may affect your anonymity.
  </ul>
</ul>

Conclusion:
<ul>
  <li>If modesty and consideration of the bathroom experience of others are higher priority, keep the "fanlight" on.
  <li>If stealth and awareness are higher priority, keep the "fanlight" off.
</ul>
